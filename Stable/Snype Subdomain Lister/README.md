## INTRODUCTION

**_Snype_** is an automated Subdomain Lister. Also, my personal subdomain lister tool. 

 

## DETAILS

- As of now, it takes **domain name** as input and then, lists out the subdomains of that particular domain. 

- Very useful for Penetration Testing.

- Be sure to Check out my other tools too! [**Check Out My Previous Programs**](https://github.com/P0intMaN?tab=repositories). 

- Available for both **Windows** and **Linux**



## THE INTERFACE WALKTHROUGH

- **_Snype_** interface is divided into two parts --> **Input Interface** and **Execution Interface**

- **Input Interface** allows you to enter the domain name (You can also tweak the code to accept **ip adresses** as well. If you don't know, then chill, I will be rolling out **_Snype 2.0_** with enhanced features). Just enter the domain name as the input. 

- **Execution Interface** puts **_Snype_** into action. It tries to find the subdomains of the target site.
