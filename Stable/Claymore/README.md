# CLAYMORE
###### Developed by 'The P0intMaN'
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=P0intMaN&label=REPO+VIEWS) 


## INTRODUCTION
**_Claymore_** is a **Targeted Mass Emailing Program** developed to attack emails with large number of requests (or messages). Email Bombing, as it is known in the Hacking terminology, is one of the most effective way to smoke screen sensitive information or to hide breach alerts. 

###### The screenshots are outdated. The newer version ( VERSION 1.1.3 ) interface looks very interesting!

## DETAILS
Just like my [**previous programs**](https://github.com/P0intMaN?tab=repositories), **_Claymore_** has a user-friendly interface that takes input from the attacker and performs attacks on the targeted email.
The interface is very secure and is divided into four segments --> **Beginning Interface, Email Setup, Bomb Configuration and Execution**

Can be accessed by both Linux and **Windows systems** ( Working on Linux release )

Many of the email service providers *prevent* or *'spams'* the auto-generated Email Bombs effectively. But, my programme can **easily bypass this through a Clever Little Technique.**


## BEFORE INSTALLING CLAYMORE
Please ensure that the following is done before installing **_Claymore_**:

- Create a new Email account **_SOLELY_** for this purpose.

- If you have created a GMAIL account, then **_turn ON 'Less Secure App Access_**' inside the '**_Manage Your Google Account_**' option

- The newly created Email account should not be linked with any services as **_Claymore_** will ask the 'Attacker's Email ID and Password to perform Massive Mail Listing and Bombing on the victim' ---- **( THE CLEVER LITTLE TECHNIQUE :P )**

- Take a seat back, have a cup of tea/coffee and relax.. Let **_Claymore_** do the job for ya..  :)
