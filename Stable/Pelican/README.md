## INTRODUCTION
**_Pelican_** is a Simple to use and Fast **Port Scanner** developed to detect open ports which will help you to discover various hidden services and exploit them. Hackers and Cybersecurity Experts use Port Scan to scan out vulnerable or open ports that are accidently left open by the system ( since there are a total of **65535 ports** )  
###### The screenshots are outdated. The newer version ( VERSION 1.1.4 ) interface looks very interesting!

## DETAILS
 - Just like my [**previous programs**](https://github.com/P0intMaN?tab=repositories), **_Pelican_** also comes with a **user-friendly** interface and is very easy to use. **_Pelican_** Port Scanner has successfully sniffed out various open ports and has helped many individuals to be aware of them. 

 - Scans on an **_entire range of networks_**. Be it your *Laptop, any Website, Printer, Modem... You name it!*

 - Currently compatible on **Windows**.

 - **Linux version** is now available! 

## THE INTERFACE WALKTHROUGH
- The interface is divided into three parts --> **Beginning Interface**, **Method Of Scanning Interface** and **Port Scanning**

- The **Beginning Interface** prompts you to input the network details ( ip adress or website name) 

- **Method of Scanning Interface** has two more sub-parts --> **MANUAL SCAN** and **AUTOMATIC SCAN**

- **MANUAL SCAN** scans for only those particular ports that the user inputs and returns the status. (*Can be used as a confirmation tool*)

- **AUTOMATIC SCAN** scans the entire port and returns the status of **all the Open Ports** detected by **_Pelican_**
